Create a Simple RESTful API into this backend (30 mins)
Description: Add a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a "Notes" application into this project.
Requirements:
Implement endpoints:
POST /notes to create a new note.
GET /notes to retrieve all notes.
GET /notes/:id to retrieve a specific note by ID.
PUT /notes/:id to update a note.
DELETE /notes/:id to delete a note.
Use an in-memory data structure (like an array or dictionary) to store the notes (no need for a database).
Result shows on console or in simple page on frontend.
